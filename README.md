# Estimating Exponent for Pythagorean Method of Expected Win Percentage in Various Leagues

## Background
* [Pythagorean theory of baseball](https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Pythagorean_Theorem_of_Baseball)
* [Basketball ESPN expected win%](http://www.espn.com/nba/stats/rpi)
* [pythagorean method for expected win%](http://www.rawbw.com/~deano/helpscrn/pyth.html)
* [Correlated Gaussian Method for expected win%](http://www.rawbw.com/~deano/helpscrn/corrgauss.html)

Bill James defined the "Pythagorean Theory of Baseball," so named because of superficial similarity to the Pythagorean Theorum for finding the length of the hypatenuse c of a right triangle abc: ````a^2 + b^2 = c^2````. Other statisticians have since adapted the method for other sports, with different exponents to account for different scoring systems. For example, in basketball, ESPN uses ^16.5. 

How closely do these numbers work for recent seasons? What numbers should be used for other sports? How have the numbers changed over time, and are they actually any good for other sports? I will also explore the Correlated Gaussian Method, which is more advanced and generally considered (by whom?) toe be more accurate for a wider variety of games.

## Collection
Scrapers similar to my previous ones, but collecting points scored for and against and comparing that to win% for various leagues.
